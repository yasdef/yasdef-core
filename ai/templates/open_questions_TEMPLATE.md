# Open Questions - Template

This file records non-blocking questions and clarifications that should be addressed when starting a step's "Plan and discuss the step" bullet.

Rules:
- Group questions under the relevant step heading (e.g., "## Step 1.11 Security").
- Only create headings for steps that exist in `ai/implementation_plan.md` to avoid orphan questions.
- Keep questions concise and actionable.
- Remove questions once answered and captured in decisions, plan updates, or implemented changes.

Template:
## Step X.Y <Step name>
- <Question>
- No open questions.
