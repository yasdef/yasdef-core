# User Review Insights - Template

This file records durable user-review feedback as rules, with references to the accepted implementation.

Rules:
- Write generalizable rules (not one-off fixes).
- Capture what was implemented wrong, what the user proposed, and how the implementation changed.
- Always include references to the refactored code so future reviews can anchor on the accepted pattern.
