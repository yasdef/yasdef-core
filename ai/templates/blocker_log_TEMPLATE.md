# Blocker Log

This file records blocking unknowns discovered while working an in-progress step.

Rules:
- Only add blockers under steps that are already in progress in `ai/implementation_plan.md` (at least one bullet marked `[x]`).
- Remove blockers once resolved or captured as follow-up work in `ai/implementation_plan.md`.
- Non-blocking questions belong in `ai/open_questions.md`.

Template:
